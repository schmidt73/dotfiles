About
=====

This contains instructions to setup my (Henri Schmidt) emacs
configuration. The goal here is that given a blank environment I can
painlessly set up emacs.

To get my configuration to this point, I have had to completely
refactor it. [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package)
has been of considerable benefit to me setting this up.

Installation
============

The steps to setup are as follows:

1. Install the most recent version of emacs (24+ and 26+ preferably).
2. Replace the default emacs configuration file with the one given.
3. Run emacs!

It might take a few minutes to install all the required plugins. Once
complete, everything should be setup and installed properly.
